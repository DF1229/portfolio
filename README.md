# portfolio
This repository is where I store the code used for hosting my portfolio website.
If you came here to look for how I solved certain problems, you're in the right place!

There are certain files that are not hosted on this repository, have a look at the `.gitignore` if you want to know what these are.

## Why a portfolio?
During my time as a student, I decided it would be a good idea to have a place to display projects I worked on.
The site is meant to be publicly available, so anyone I give the link to can see what I've made.

## What is the goal?
The goal for this project is to create a place for me to showcase all the projects I worked on, or at least the ones I'm willing and able to show. In the end I want to be able to just give someone the link, and trust that they will find everything they need.
Aside from that, I have an overall goal with all of my projects to keep everything as open-source as possible, although some projects or files simply can't be released due to security concerns.
