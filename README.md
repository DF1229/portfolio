# portfolio
I started this project during some down-time from school. I didn't have anything to do so I decided I should put some effort into how I would present myself to potential employers.
Of course, my portfolio is not only meant for potential employers. Anyone who is interested in my work, or simply wants to look around, can do so here.

The overall goal with all my projects is to keep as much as possible open-source. That is also why I decided to put my portfolio on github, with as much details as I could include.
There is one file in particular (`.env`) I could not include, this file includes things like the link to the database, but also the secret key used to generate access tokens and user passwords.
Aside from that file, almost everything is publicly available in the repository.

I decided to license my work under the MIT license, for the simple reason of supporting open-source projects.
